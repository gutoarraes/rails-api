# Rails-API

This project was not concluded and discontinued. 

This is an API that validates users so they are able to login to a front end in another [codebase](https://github.com/francomoraes/portfolio-games) made with a React.  


### Greatest challenge

The biggest challenge was editing the `secrets.enc.yml` file. I wasn't able to find a work around in my Windows OS, so I eventually used a VM, installed MacOS and managed to edit the file. 

This gave me the opportunity to manage `rails` versions, configuraing environment variables, and following through on error messages, all on an operating system (OS) that I had very limited experience on.  


### Acknowledgements

Huge shoutout to my friend [Franco Moraes](https://github.com/francomoraes) who gave me the idea and the opportunity to start this project and piggyback off of his React [application](https://github.com/francomoraes/portfolio-games).
